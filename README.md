# Penalty-ShotOut-Game
A simple game of Penalty Shotout based on the pygame package in python...

The game is made as an starting learning project in my 2nd Semester using [Python-3.0](https://www.python.org/) and [Pygame-1.9.1](http://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)

# Requirements
To Run the game you have to install [Python 3.0 or higher version](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Pygame-1.9.1 or higher Python Package](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).

And then just run the game file, named #Play.py or #PlayWithMusic.py :) and Enjoy.

And Please make your changes in a specific branch and request to pull into master! If you can, please make sure the game fully works before sending the PR, as that will help speed up the process.
